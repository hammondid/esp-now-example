# esp-now-example
A simple example using ESP-Now on the ESP32 with Arduino

It took me a long time to get ESP-Now working, so I wanted to share a simple example to hopefully speed up the process for others. This example uses no security and simply broadcasts packets, but can be easily modified to send arbitrary data.
